# ofxOpenFixture

Never finished addon. Development started in June 2017 by Henrique. It was meant to load native fixture files from the great project 
https://github.com/OpenLightingProject/open-fixture-library

https://open-fixture-library.org/



It can add native OFL fixture files in JSON format, or accept its own format. similar to configparser.
